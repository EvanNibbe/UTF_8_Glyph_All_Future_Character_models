# UTF_8_Glyph_All_Future_Character_models
A standard for a UTF-8 extension to end all UTF-8 extensions. This system (when implemented) allows the creation of every kind of visual representation of meaning with respect to a character in text, to the extent that is possible with a small enough character that a book written with this method will still fit on a writable CD.
