# UTF_8_Glyph_All_Future_Character_models
A standard for a UTF-8 extension to end all UTF-8 extensions. This system (when implemented) allows the creation of every kind of visual representation of meaning with respect to a character in text, to the extent that is possible with a small enough character that a book written with this method will still fit on a writable CD.

This system includes support for detailed animations within the model such that there don't need to be any memory-intensive lookups. These animations on the lowest level just constitute 16 possible speeds per axis per vertex, limited to the sides of the bounding box that the given tetrahedron is drawn within (where the speed is with respect to the size of that bounding box). This is important to create emojis based on excitement (like the act of smiling or jumping or dancing), as well as to create glyphs equivalent in appearance to Ultron or Jarvis in the holograph model shown by Iron Man early in the "Avengers: Age of Ultron" movie.
